		<h2>What we believe</h2>
		<p>At DOBOKI, we believe that every pet deserves the joy of play and discovery. We trust in the power of quality and innovation to enhance the lives of pets and their owners alike. We value the strong bond between pets and their families, striving to strengthen it with every product we offer.</p>
		<p>South Korea's pet industry, known for its rapid growth and innovation, has always stood out to me as a beacon of what's possible in pet care and entertainment. The attention to detail, quality, and creativity found in Korean pet products is unparalleled, yet access to these products outside of Korea remains limited.
		</p>
		<p>DOBOKI is an online boutique dedicated to enriching the lives of pets and their owners through a curated selection of high-quality, innovative toys originating from South Korea. Our mission is to bring joy and entertainment to pets everywhere while providing pet owners with unique products that cannot be found anywhere else. This website is conceived out of a passion for pets and a desire to share South Korea's exceptional approach to pet care and entertainment with a global audience.</p>
